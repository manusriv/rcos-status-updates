## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week, I researched git and how the branches work since I have minimal experience with it. I also looked into different curriculum applications that are kid-friendly, such as BrainPop, to get some ideas to model our UI experience off of.

I also attended the Call for Code Hackathon where we developed a web application that connects community members during a natural disaster so they can communicate and exchange supplies.

## This Week's Plan

My plan this week is to research and learn about ReactJS and work on the tutorial.I also plan to continue researching github and javascript.

## Anything Blocking?

I have very minimal experience with web development which presents me a large learning curve within this project.
