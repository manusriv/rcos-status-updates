## Last Week's Accomplishments

I learned more javascript and intro to react.

## This Week's Plan

My plan this week is to research and learn about ReactJS and work more on the tutorial.I also plan to continue researching github and javascript. We are going to have our first curriculum meeting where I will get a detailed plan from my mentor so I can tailor what to learn to what is relevant to our project.
