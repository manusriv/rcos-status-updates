## Last Week's Accomplishments

I received my curriculum assignment last week to create interactive tutorials about conditionals for students to learn. I set up a reactJS local development environment and looked into ideas of ways to present conditionals.

## This Week's Plan
I would like to build one of these ideas for students to use.
## Anything Blocking?
My reactJS knowledge is limited but I hope to learn as I work.
